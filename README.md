# STM32_NRF24L01_Receiver
NRF24L01 Wireless module receiver mode 

Using NRF24L01 as receiver and controlling 4 LED group with PWM. One other NRF24L01 attached with STM32F4 as Transmitter and control the led group by Joystick (cheap one, sorry). 

If you can check the NRF24L01 datasheet this codes make more sense to you. NRF24L01's Enhanced Shockburst Mode is not used in here.
